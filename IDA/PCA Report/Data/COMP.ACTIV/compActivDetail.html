<BODY><H2>comp-activ Database</H2>
<P>The comp-activ databases is a collection of a computer systems activity
measures . The data was collected from a  Sun Sparcstation  20/712 with 128
Mbytes of memory running in a multi-user university department.  Users would
typically be doing a large variety of tasks ranging from accessing the internet,
editing files or running very cpu-bound  programs. The data was collected 
continuously  on two separate occasions. On both occassions, system activity was
gathered every 5 seconds. The final dataset
is taken from both occasions with equal numbers of observations coming from 
each collection epoch in random order.</P>
<H3>System measures used:</H3>
<OL><LI>lread -  Reads (transfers per second ) between system memory and user
memory </LI>
<LI>lwrite - writes (transfers per second)  between system memory and user
memory</LI>
<LI>scall - Number of system calls of all types per second</LI>
<LI>sread - Number of system <EM>read</EM> calls per second .</LI>
<LI>swrite - Number of system  <EM>write</EM> calls per second .</LI>
<LI>fork - Number of system  <EM>fork</EM> calls  per second.</LI>
<LI>exec - Number of system <EM>exec</EM> calls per second.</LI>
<LI>rchar - Number of characters transferred per second by system  read calls</LI>
<LI>wchar - Number of characters transfreed per second by system write calls</LI>
<LI>pgout -  Number of  page out requests per second</LI>
<LI>ppgout - Number of pages, paged out per second</LI>
<LI>pgfree - Number of pages per second placed on the free list.</LI>
<LI>pgscan - Number of pages checked if they can be freed per second</LI>
<LI>atch - Number of page attaches  (satisfying a page fault by reclaiming a
page in memory) per second</LI>
<LI>pgin - Number of <EM>page-in</EM> requests per second</LI>
<LI>ppgin -  Number of  pages paged in per second</LI>
<LI>pflt - Number of page faults caused by protection errors <EM>(copy-on-writes)</EM>.</LI>
<LI>vflt - Number of  page faults caused by address translation .</LI>
<LI>runqsz  - Process run queue size</LI>
<LI>freemem - Number of memory pages available to user processes</LI>
<LI>freeswap - Number of disk blocks available for  page swapping.</LI>
<LI>usr -  Portion of time (%) that cpus run in user mode</LI>
<LI>sys - Portion  of time (%) that cpus run in system mode</LI>
<LI>wio - Portion of time (%) that cpus are idle waiting for block IO</LI>
<LI>idle - Portion of time (%) that cpus are otherwise idle </LI></OL>
