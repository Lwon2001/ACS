<BODY><H2 ALIGN=> The Image-seg dataset </H2>

<P> The information is a replica of the notes for the segmentation dataset
from the <A HREF=" http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mlearn/MLRepository.html"> UCI </A>
repository. 

<H3>1. Title: Image Segmentation data </H3>

<H3>2. Source Information </H3>
<UL>
<LI>   Creators: Vision Group, University of Massachusetts </LI>
<LI>   Donor: Vision Group (Carla Brodley, brodley@cs.umass.edu) </LI>
<LI>   Date: November, 1990 </LI>
</UL>

<H3>3. Past Usage: None yet published </H3>

<H3>4. Relevant Information: </H3>
<P>
   The instances were drawn randomly from a database of 7 outdoor 
   images.  The images were handsegmented to create a classification
   for every pixel.  
<P>
   Each instance is a 3x3 region.

<H3>5. Number of Instances: Training data: 210  Test data: 2100 </H3>

<H3>6. Number of Attributes: 19 continuous attributes </H3>

<H3>7. Attribute Information: </H3>
<OL>
<LI>   region-centroid-col:  the column of the center pixel of the region. </LI>
<LI>  region-centroid-row:  the row of the center pixel of the region.</LI>
<LI>  region-pixel-count:  the number of pixels in a region = 9. </LI>
<LI>  short-line-density-5:  the results of a line extraction algorithm that 
         counts how many lines of length 5 (any orientation) with
         low contrast, less than or equal to 5, go through the region. </LI>
<LI>  short-line-density-2:  same as short-line-density-5 but counts lines
         of high contrast, greater than 5. </LI>
<LI>  vedge-mean:  measure the contrast of horizontally
         adjacent pixels in the region.  There are 6, the mean and 
         standard deviation are given.  This attribute is used as
        a vertical edge detector. </LI>
<LI>  vegde-sd:  (see 6) </LI>
<LI>  hedge-mean:  measures the contrast of vertically adjacent
          pixels. Used for horizontal line detection. </LI>
<LI>  hedge-sd: (see 8).
<LI> intensity-mean:  the average over the region of (R + G + B)/3 </LI>
<LI> rawred-mean: the average over the region of the R value. </LI>
<LI> rawblue-mean: the average over the region of the B value. </LI>
<LI> rawgreen-mean: the average over the region of the G value. </LI>
<LI> exred-mean: measure the excess red:  (2R - (G + B)) </LI>
<LI> exblue-mean: measure the excess blue:  (2B - (G + R)) </LI>
<LI> exgreen-mean: measure the excess green:  (2G - (R + B)) </LI>
<LI>    17. value-mean:  3-d nonlinear transformation
         of RGB. (Algorithm can be found in Foley and VanDam, Fundamentals
         of Interactive Computer Graphics) </LI>
<LI> saturation-mean:  (see 17) </LI>
<LI> hue-mean:  (see 17) </LI>
</OL>

<H3> 8. Missing Attribute Values: None </H3>

<H3> 9. Class Distribution: </H3>
<UL>
<LI>   Classes:  brickface, sky, foliage, cement, window, path, grass. </LI>

<LI>   30 instances per class for training data. </LI>
<LI>   300 instances per class for test data. </LI>
</UL>

<H3>10. Modifications for Delve</H3>
<OL>
<LI> The <EM>data</EM> and <EM>test</EM> files were combined and then
stratified to ensure equal representation of the output classes in each of the
Delve task-instance training sets. </LI>
<LI> Attribute 3 (region-pixel-count) was deleted since it is a constant for
this dataset.</LI>
</OL>
