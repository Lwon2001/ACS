# Evaluation Methods & Statistics



## Lecture 4: Integrity in Research



### 1. Principles

- Declare your assumptions and expectations.

- Explain your hypotheses (*a priori*).
- Report what could affect the experiment’s outcome and how to improve.
- Report and explain potential confounds or alternative explanations.



### 2. Experimental design and ethics

At the very least, you should:

- Have good reason to conduct an experiment involving **human** participants.
- Make every effort to ensure the protocol is safe, secure, robust and reliable.
- Ensure that dignity and well-being of participants is protected.

Dilemma of deception and misinformation:

- If a participant knows (or can reasonably expect) what your experimental results will be, will they **change** how they perform in the task?
- If you design the study to prevent them doing this, are you **deceiving** (or lying) to them?



### 3. Impacts on participants

1. Hawthorne effect

Presence of experimenters along can *sometimes* influence people’s performance.

2. Social desirability bias

Participants will report answers to questions that they believe to be socially acceptable.

3. Demand Characteristics

Participants will change their natural behaviour to suit their interpretation of what the experiment seeks to prove.

4. Effect of Expectancy

Participants could align their performance to a target defined by their peers.



### 4. UK Data Protection Act (2018)

### 5. Declaration of Helsinki 2013

Basic principles:

- Respect for the individual
- Respect for individual’s right to self-determination
- Respect for individual’s right to make informed decisions
- Investigator’s duty of care

Operating principles:

- Research should be based on thorough **knowledge** of scientific background to the study.
- Research should involve careful **assessment** of risks and benefits of conducting the study.
- Research should have a reasonable **benefit** for population studied.
- Research should be conducted by suitably **trained** **investigators**.
- Research should using approved **protocols**, subject to independent ethical review and oversight by properly convened committee.
