# Jan 2020 Monthly Review

---



### 1. Theme of the Year

​	It has been a terrible start of this decade. I didn't set goals at the new year or the Spring Festival, because my mind was then occupied with the tension between the US and Iran and the coronavirus outbreak in China. Neither of them indicated a better time to come. Inspired by a video from CGP Grey, I think it is better to set a theme of this year, since my goals would be easily compromised by myself given what happened in the first month of 2020. 

​	I decide 2020 is my year of ***consistency***. The aim of setting a theme instead of unreachable goals is to actively encourage me towards what I wish to achieve. The promise won't be broken by an early failure or any incident. Whenever I am running out of passion or energy, I will just tell myself: Hey it's the year of consistency, you can do better than that! I mean it could be cheeky to avoid failing goals by calling them a theme of consistency, but it is broad enough, which can brace me up in many scenarios.



### 2. Week 1 to Week 3

​	This term starts in a very slow pace. IDA is mostly about the *Information Retrieval* analysis. It will touch on visualisation and clustering later on, but I must say they are not novel knowledge. I picked up some ideas on **NLP** though, such as BERT. I think NLP is an interesting topic to look into if I have the time. IDA will help with textual search algorithms and ranking techniques as well, which are practical in development. *Dimensional Reduction* and *Clustering methods* are fundamental to my Mini-project study. I hope they can come to help in later weeks.

​	NISO is an interesting course. The essence of it is about **heuristic representation** of an unsolvable or costly problem. I am so curious about *Evolutionary Algorithms* and other forms of nature-inspired algorithms. However, the lecturer is irresponsible at the least. All the lab sessions were cancelled due to timetable clash, and there's no remedy for that. Luckily, this course uses MATLAB/ Octave, which is familiar to me thanks to the Coursera ML courses. I think I have the passion to go through these problems.

​	Mini project kicked a slow start, too. The meeting in week 2 was meaningless, the next in week 3 was about assertion of the tasks in this project. I refined my original proposal and listed some key points to Peter. He suggested to find another clustering method to deal with the sparse data. I need to choose either a customised clustering logic, or an binary clustering algorithm. I need to **read a lot**! Be **consistent** with my proposal.

​	From Week 3, I started taking notes as Markdown files using Typora. It is a great tool for typing. I think it can eventually improve my writing skill and adapt to **thinking** at the same time of typing. This includes lecture notes, meeting notes, monthly review, etc.



### 3. Routines 

1. Many of my routines failed in this term. *Things, Anki and Reading*, they will be back in the next week.
2. I set up some notifications on my iPad as daily routine reminders. It is the first step to healthy notification panel.
3. I changed my sleep time to a healthy one. Now I can get up early in the morning. Be **consistent** with this!
4. Ubuntu is returning as my primary OS. Chrome apps work so well. No Macbook Pro 14 dream.
5. I need to tackle with the long journey on the train. It keeps my school attendance rate low. (~50%)
6. Less gaming and game videos.



### 4. What to do next ?

1. **NISO** TSP in Week 6
2. **IDA** PCA Report in Week 8
3. **Mini Project** structure and research done before Week 7
