## Lecture 5: Evolutionary Algorithms



### 1. Evolution

â€‹		**Change** in the **inherited characteristics** of biological populations over successive generations.

 - Heritable characteristics - heritable traits

 - Change

    - *Mutations*: changes in the DNA sequence

    - *Crossover*: reshuffling of genes between populations

      

   1) Driving force of evolution - natural selection

    - Living species are *reproductions* of earlier species with genetic variations

    - genetic variations that enhance survival remain **more common**. 

      

   2) Relationship between evolution and optimisation
