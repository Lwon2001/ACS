## Lecture 2 : Randomised Algorithms



> “For many problems, a randomised algorithm is the simplest, the
> fastest or both.” - Prabhakar Raghavan.



### 1. Categories of Algorithms by Design Paradigm

- Divide and conquer
- Dynamic programming
- Mathematical programming
- Search and enumeration
  - Brute force
  - Improved brute force
  - **Heuristic algorithms**
    - Local search
    - **Randomised algorithms**, including *Evolutionary Computation*, etc.



### 2. Heuristic Algorithms

- **Heuristic**: a usually simple algorithm that produces a **good enough** solution for a problem in a **reasonable time frame**.
- Solutions are usually non-optimal but satisfactory
  - Faster
  - Trade off completeness and accuracy for speed
- Usually to solve problems that are otherwise difficult
- Includes deterministic and **randomised algorithms**



### 3. Randomised Algorithms

​	An heuristic algorithm that **makes random choices** during execution to produce a result.

- Takes a source of random numbers to make random choices

- Behaviour (output) or running time can *vary* even on a fixed input.
