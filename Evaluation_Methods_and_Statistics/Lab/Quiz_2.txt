Quiz instructions

Using the 'DronesMetrics' file, answer the questions in this quiz using R.

The tests that you need to perform can be found in the lab class notes (and, where appropriate, the questions in the quiz will direct you to specific tests or procedures).

I have updated the lab class notes and these will help you answer the questions.

I would advise that you make a copy of the questions in the quiz and spend time working with R to find the answers to each question. Then complete the quiz based on your notes.
